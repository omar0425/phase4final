# Rotten Potatos

I created this application for my phase 4 final assessment. The purpose of this application is for a user to be able to add movies to the database, along with other users, and be able to review them. On the reviews page, a user can add reviews along with ratings. The current user can also sort the movies they may have reviewed on the movies page.


## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```
git clone git@github.com:omar0425/phase4final.git
cd phase4final
bundle install
npm install --prefix client
```

You can use the following commands to run the application:
run the backend on http://localhost:3000
```
rails s
```
run the frontend on http://localhost:4000

```
npm start --prefix client
```
